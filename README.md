# WorkoutTracker
WorkoutTracker is a Fitness App that allows you to stop having to keep track of the repetitions of each exercise since it will do it for you. But that's not all it does, as it memorizes the order of the exercises and, as soon as you have finished performing all the repetitions for one exercise, it will remind you which one is next
